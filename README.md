# Exercise 1

This is a simple problem solving exercise to solve [project Euler Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1) using code.

I am going to rewrite the problem thus:-

_Create a Function to list all the numbers up to a Number *N* that is a multiple of 3 or 5, and then return the sum of these numbers._

## Structure

This is a starter exercise - we shall follow a structure.  As a structure this is a start to get an idea of some concepts in programming, but not necessarily the best solution to the problem given.

### Part 0 - Functions Statements and operators

Aim: 

* To be able to run a python program. 
* Know what a function is and how to call one.
* Know what the basic data types are
*  know what an operator is and how to write a statement.

In the first part we will run a simple program. 

Reference [The python standard library - Built in types](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html)

### Part 1 - Writing a function

### Part 2 - If

### Part 3 - Loops

### Part 4 - Lists

### Part 5 - Putting it all together 

## Extension 
Can you think of a better way to have solved this?
